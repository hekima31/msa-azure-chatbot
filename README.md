This is a repo containing my presentation resources on how to use AI Cognitive Services: QnA Maker and Azure Bot Service to create a no code solution - a bot that queries that can receive natural language queries and returns solutions from unstructured data (such as a book chapter in our case). Very relevant in the education space!
